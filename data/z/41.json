Emerging from the crowd, a guy in white sneakers and a bright yellow hoodie skitters onto the empty dance floor.With plenty of room to move, he drops suddenly, catching himself on one hand and kicking his legs in the air. The next thing you know, he flips upside-down, spinning on his head.\u201cI\u2019m a little bit anxious,\u201d he says later. \u201cWhen I get like that, I\u2019m making it up as I go.\u201dThe nerves get to him because this b-boy named Yuri isn\u2019t just breakdancing. He has reached the final of a regional qualifier with a spot in the national championships at stake.\u201cFreakin\u2019 crazy,\u201d he says.To the dancers who competed in the recent Red Bull BC One contest in Hollywood \u2014 and hundreds of fans who came to watch \u2014 \u201cbreaking,\u201d as it is correctly known, is no less athletic than gymnastics or figure skating.Through round after round of one-on-one \u201cbattles,\u201d competitors must execute basic footwork and perform the sort of power moves and airborne tricks that score extra points. Judges watch from the side, scribbling notes, scrutinizing each nuance.Outsiders might scoff, but the International Olympic Committee has recognized breaking as a high-level competitive sport with a network of contests held worldwide. Earlier this year, organizers of the 2024 Summer Games in Paris proposed adding it to their program, citing an \u201cunmissable opportunity\u201d to attract young fans.The possibility causes Yuri to grin, thinking about validation in the form of gold medals and television coverage. The 28-year-old from Brazil says: \u201cMaybe a lot of people are going to look at us in a better way.\u201d::B-boy Yuri performs in a battle during the Red Bull BC One All Star Tour on April 27, 2019 at Academy LA in Hollywood.Go back to the early days, to the streets of New York City in the 1970s.Deejays extracted the instrumental \u201cbreak\u201d sections from the middle of funk or hip-hop songs and looped them together \u2014 tons of backbeat \u2014 to fuel a new culture with its own rules, fashion and language. You could call it performance art, but there was a competitive edge as onlookers circled around in \u201ccyphers,\u201d watching dancers try to outdo each other.Breaking eventually seeped into the mainstream by way of movies and television \u2014 even the \u201cMighty Morphin Power Rangers\u201d started flashing moves.That was how Ryan Porter got exposed as a kid. He and some friends decided to give it a try.\u201cThey could do it right away,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI played lots of sports \u2014 basketball, football, soccer, tennis \u2014 and I thought \u2018This is ridiculous\u2019 because I was the most athletic one of them but I couldn\u2019t do the moves.\u201dIn an age before YouTube, Porter downloaded videos from file-sharing sites and joined a gymnastics team, he says, \u201cfor the sole purpose of learning to do flips.\u201d He gradually acquired the fundamentals.Routines usually begin with top rock, a series of steps meant to show attitude and a sense of rhythm. Competitors then drop down to the all-important footwork, hovering inches above the floor, supported by hands and feet in rapid motion.The power moves are more acrobatic, all those flips and spins requiring upper-body strength. Each series of tricks is punctuated by a freeze, a sudden pause, often in twisted or inverted position, to emphasize a beat in the music.\u201cEven when you\u2019re not practicing, you\u2019re thinking about it,\u201d Porter says. \u201cYou might see somebody walk around or do something goofy and you\u2019re like, \u2018Yo, I can turn that into a move.\u2019 \u201dOne more thing about breaking appeals to him \u2014 the distinct, in-your-face rivalry of one-on-one battles.Built tall and lean with wire-rim glasses, the 27-year-old shows up early to the Red Bull BC One, stepping inside a hall illuminated by flickering LED panels that span the length of the ceiling.Among the few breakers who perform under their given name, Porter spends the next few hours visiting with friends and warming up. When officials post the bracket, pitting him against a previous champion named Ali, he tugs a black do-rag over his head.\u201cHardest battle in the Top 16,\u201d he says. \u201cHe was the guy I wanted.\u201dA crowd gathers, with some people on tip-toes to see from farther back, as the battle begins. Porter directs a few early moves at Ali, pointing and kicking toward his foe, who paces at the edge of the floor. Ali shakes his head, responding with hand signals that every breaker understands.If your opponent stumbles or \u201ccrashes\u201d on a move, you bend down and slap the floor. If he dances slightly off the beat, you tap your ear.This hip-hop form of trash talk continues between Porter and Ali for several minutes as they take turns performing routines of 30-40 seconds each.\u201cIt got me going,\u201d Porter says. \u201cWe were in a great battle.\u201d::The Red Bull BC One All Star Tour kicked off on April 27, 2019 at Academy LA in Hollywood. Organizers for the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris hope to add the sport to their program.The news out of Paris took Mark Dyreson by surprise. Breaking in the Summer Games? It seemed insane to the Penn State professor who studies Olympic history.\u201cThen,\u201d he says, \u201cI thought about synchronized swimming.\u201dThe IOC has a history of adding unconventional events in an effort to stay relevant and attract a young demographic.Snowboarding, freestyle skiing and beach volleyball have become fan favorites. Others \u2014 synchronized swimming, trampoline and BMX cycling \u2014 have yet to draw big audiences.\u201cWe all have our definition of how far is too far,\u201d Dyreson says.Still, additions have become more common in the wake of recent IOC reforms that allow host cities to include \u2014 on a one-time basis \u2014 one or more events of their choosing. Paris 2024 organizers nominated breaking because of its popularity in France; they describe it as a \u201cquintessentially urban sport\u201d that is \u201ccheap and accessible\u201d and enjoys worldwide \u201cpopularity among young people.\u201dLike video game players, b-boys and b-girls \u2014 the \u201cb\u201d stands for break, by most accounts \u2014 usually perform under pseudonyms. They concoct names such as RoxRite, Cheerito, Hi Jack and Lil Zoo based on personality or approach to dancing. Like snowboarders, they embody a distinct style.The music ranges from James Brown to Run-DMC to Afrika Bambaataa and the fashion leans toward streetwear, with loose-fitting pants, sneakers for traction and windbreakers for spinning across the floor on your shoulder or back.In the Olympic world, this kind of pop culture has commercial and sponsorship potential. It also helps that breaking connects, however tenuously, to traditional sport.Over the years, b-boys and b-girls have borrowed generously from gymnastics. They took a pommel horse maneuver known as the Thomas Flair \u2014 hands down, legs swirling to the ceiling \u2014 and turned it into a dance move. When they added a mid-air spin, gymnastics borrowed it right back.\u201cYou take something and make it even more difficult,\u201d says Neguin, a b-boy champion who served as a judge at the Red Bull BC One. \u201cGymnastics looked at us and said, \u2018We\u2019re going to start using that.\u2019\u201dBreaking got a test-run at the 2018 Youth Summer Olympics Games in Buenos Aires, where judges scored routines for technique, variety, musicality and personality. An array of countries \u2014 Canada, France, Japan, Russia \u2014 came away with medals, satisfying the IOC\u2019s desire for global relevance.DJ Lean Rock, a veteran breaker and deejay, supplied music for the competition and was impressed.\u201cIt was the first time in an Olympic setting, so I wasn\u2019t sure how it would go,\u201d he says. \u201cIt worked really well.\u201dDJ Lean Rock provides the music for a public session at Salazar Park Community Center  the night before the competition.::The crowd arrives at noon, lingering in the parking lot before drifting inside. Competition isn\u2019t the only attraction at the Red Bull BC One \u2014 throughout the day, cyphers erupt spontaneously on the periphery of the dance floor.A group gathers in the corner or near the bar and someone inevitably starts breaking. This free-form ambiance has always appealed to a young b-girl named Pebblz.\u201cJust the raw, dope energy,\u201d she says. \u201cI want to be part of the community.\u201dIt is a big day for the 16-year-old who has traveled from San Diego. Dressed in a dark jacket and white sweatpants, she scores an upset win over Crissy B in the first round and advances to face Wonda, a veteran she has grown up watching.\u201cIt\u2019s like, whoa,\u201d Pebblz says. \u201cI started thinking about it \u2026 sometimes you have to check yourself.\u201dCompetitive breaking requires a blend of strategy, instinct and poise. A dancer might begin with a plan, but must be ready to adapt on the fly.If your opponent stumbles on a freeze or a flare, you can add that element on your next turn and impress the judges by getting it right. If your opponent executes a dazzling set of tricks, you had better respond.Porter faces that sort of pressure against Ali, who ups the ante with a series of power moves near the end of a battle that has fans cheering. The final seconds are crucial.\u201cI was so focused on answering that I blanked on other stuff I needed to do,\u201d Porter says. \u201cI ended up repeating toward the end.\u201dHis lapse proves decisive, with judges awarding the battle to his opponent. Frustrated, Porter retreats behind the stage and can\u2019t help performing a few of the moves he should have done in the first place.\u201cAnytime you lose, you\u2019re disappointed,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I have to keep the energy going because we have another big competition in June, down in San Diego.\u201dThat contest will coincide with an IOC session in Switzerland where members will vote on breaking and Paris\u2019 three other proposed sports \u2014 surfing, skateboarding and sport climbing \u2014 with a simple majority required.The newcomers that receive approval are guaranteed one shot to make an impression in hopes of permanent inclusion. Paris 2024 president Tony Estanguet says: \u201cWe believe these four sports are an opportunity to bring new audiences to the Olympic Games.\u201dThe demographic that shows up for the Red Bull BC One in Los Angeles \u2014 host of the 2028 Summer Games \u2014 is young and devoted, staying for almost seven hours of competition.Fans watch Pebblz get past Wonda, then defeat Feenx in the final of the b-girl\u2019s bracket. This unexpected result earns the teenager a chance to compete for the national championship in Houston later this spring.The b-boy\u2019s final comes down to the last moments as Yuri finishes against Nico Spins with a burst of footwork, then hops to his feet, twirls and grabs his crotch. The judges raise his hand as the winner.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect this,\u201d he says.His words emerge rapid-fire, punctuated by laughter. Though some breakers worry about organized sport corrupting their street-borne culture, he takes an optimistic view.\u201cDudes flipping and spinning \u2026 it\u2019s not like ballet,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is literally a gangster dance, a dance from the poor places.\u201dGold medals and television coverage might show the world a different side of what he fell \u201cmad in love\u201d with as a kid growing up in the capital city of Brasilia. Talk of the Olympics gets him excited.\u201cSerious crazy dope,\u201d he says. \u201cCan you imagine?\u201dNico Spins finished second to Yuri in the b-boy&#039;s bracket at the Red Bull BC One All Star Tour stop on April 27, 2019 at Academy LA in Hollywood.", "creator": ["David Wharton "], "author": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "David Wharton "}], "keywords": ["Gymnastics", "Swimming"], "publisher": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Los Angeles Times", "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.latimes.com/pb/resources/images/lat_icons/logo_meta.png?token=123", "width": 467, "height": 60}}, "description": "The International Olympic Committee has recognized &quot;breaking&quot; as a high-level competitive sport with a network of contests held worldwide."}
