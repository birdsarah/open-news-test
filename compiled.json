public markets with a sigh Friday, trading below its initial public offering price.The ride-hailing giant raised $8.1 billion in its IPO on Thursday by pricing shares at $45 apiece. The shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange below that IPO price and finished the day around $41.60, down 7.6%. The overall market also faltered, disturbed by an overnight escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, but it ended the day up.\u201cIt\u2019s definitely not the best day to go public. There\u2019s clearly a lot going on. A trade war with China is bad timing. There\u2019s nothing to be done about it, but it\u2019s not great timing,\u201d said former Uber advisor Bradley Tusk, who holds a stake in the company.Dan Ives, equity analyst at Wedbush Securities, said investors were being cautious after the \u201cLyft train wreck.\u201d The smaller ride-hailing company\u2019s stock has tumbled nearly 28% since its March IPO.But whereas Lyft priced its IPO above its expected range, Uber\u2019s IPO price was already conservative. The $45 per share was toward the bottom of its marketed range of $44 to $50, and it gave Uber a market value of $75.5 billion \u2014 below its last private market value of $76 billion. The fully diluted value in the Uber IPO, including restricted stock units and other shares, could have been about $82 billion, far below the $120 billion that investment bankers jockeying to lead the offering floated last year.San Francisco-based Uber was founded in 2009 when two of its co-founders \u2014 Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp \u2014 decided they wanted to be able to order a ride in a luxury car at the push of a button. With Kalanick as chief executive, the company elbowed its way into the global transportation industry.As it grew, the company was beset by a series of scandals about its flagrant disregard for transportation regulations and, internally, accusations of harassment and an aggressive, unchecked corporate culture.While planning to go public, Uber worked to clean up its image. It ousted Kalanick in 2017. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi took the helm, resolving to take a more responsible, contrite tone.Uber has salvaged some of its reputation, though it is still bleeding money as it grows. Last year, it reported an operating loss of about $3 billion; that was smaller than its $4-billion operating loss the year before. Its revenue rose to $11.3 billion in 2018 from $7.9 billion in 2017.Some \u2014 such as Ives\u2014 say Uber is poised to become a juggernaut, the \u201cAmazon of transportation.\u201dOthers are deeply skeptical that the company will be able to turn a profit.\u201cI would never ever advise anyone to invest in this company,\u201d said Ashley Nunes, a researcher at MIT who studies regulatory policy. \u201cIt\u2019s remarkable to me that a company can hemorrhage this much cash and still drum up this much interest from investors.\u201dWhen Kalanick entered the New York Stock Exchange on Friday morning with his father, Donald, he \u201cwas met with enormous applause,\u201d according to a tweet from New York Times reporter Mike Isaac.Kalanick had wanted to be on the balcony when the opening bell was rung, but he and the other co-founders were not given that honor. Drivers and early employees stood with Khosrowshahi on the balcony while Kalanick, Camp and fellow co-founder Ryan Graves watched from the floor.A parade of unicorns \u2014 tech start-ups valued at more than $1 billion \u2014 have gone public in recent years, and Uber\u2019s IPO was the most anticipated. Snapchat app maker Snap Inc. hit the market in 2017, followed by the likes of Dropbox, Pinterest and ride-hailing rival Lyft.Lyft\u2019s flop and Uber\u2019s rocky start could be a worrying sign for other unicorns that are expected to go public soon, such as Slack, Palantir and Airbnb.Uber\u2019s was the ninth-largest U.S. IPO of all time and the biggest on a U.S. exchange since Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.\u2019s $25-billion global record holder in 2014, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Ives describes Uber as a \u201cthree-headed monster\u201d consisting of its core ride-hailing business, its Uber Eats food delivery arm and and its Uber Freight shipping logistics arm.\u201cThe cherry on top of the sundae is autonomous driving technology,\u201d he said. The company\u2019s self-driving business landed a $1-billion investment last month.In pitches to potential investors before the IPO, Uber touted its plans to expand in logistics and other transportation businesses, including scooters, autonomous driving and mass transit, a person familiar with the matter has said.Arun Sundararajan, a professor at New York University\u2019s business school, said that while going public gives Uber money to capture more of the transportation market, it also could push the company to put quarterly targets ahead of its broader ambitions.\u201cThe trillion-dollar valuation will come if they can spend the next five to 10 years getting to that place where more is spent on Uber than on any other form of transportation,\u201d Sundararajan said. \u201cThe trouble is, that\u2019s going to require keeping investors at bay who are putting pressure on Uber to deliver earnings.\u201dIves shrugged at the significance of Uber\u2019s first day of trading: The company has a unique opportunity to go after its target market, he said, and what it can build in the next five or 10 years is more important.&#034;Now the question is: Will investors buy into that vision and at what price?\u201d Ives said.Bloomberg was used in compiling this report.", "creator": ["Suhauna Hussain "], "author": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Suhauna Hussain "}], "keywords": ["Uber", "China", "Snap Inc.", "Garrett Camp", "Alibaba Group"], "publisher": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Los Angeles Times", "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.latimes.com/pb/resources/images/lat_icons/logo_meta.png?token=123", "width": 467, "height": 60}}, "description": "Uber set its IPO price at $45 a share, toward the bottom of its marketed range.

And I think he absolutely owes everybody an apology,&rdquo; Gandhi said. On Thursday, asked to comment on the riots, Pitroda had said, &ldquo;hua to hua (it happened, it happened)&rdquo;. On Friday, Pitroda, who is the chief of the Indian Overseas Congress, apologised for the comment, but not before it triggered a barrage of criticism, including by his colleagues and by BJP leaders. &ldquo;Yesterday, one of the tallest leaders of the Congress, speaking in a loud voice on 1984, said, &lsquo;84 ka danga hua to hua&rsquo;. Do you know who this leader is, he is very close to the Gandhi family&hellip; this leader was a very good friend of Rajiv Gandhi and guru of Congress &lsquo;naamdar&rsquo; (dynast) president,&rdquo; Modi said at a rally in Rohtak on Friday.A day earlier, BJP chief Amit Shah highlighted Pitroda&rsquo;s controversial remark in a tweet and said it reflected the Congress&rsquo;s stand on the issue. Union ministers Arun Jaitley and Prakash Javadekar too criticised Pitroda&rsquo;s &ldquo;hua to hua&rdquo; comment.Senior leaders of the Congress distanced themselves from Pitroda&rsquo;s remarks on Friday. &ldquo;It is not the party&rsquo;s stand, the party condemns it. All leaders should be careful about what they say,&rdquo; Congress leader Abhishek Singhvi said at a press conference in Delhi. &ldquo;Congress has worked to provide justice to the victims of 1984 riots. No act of violence and riots can be forgiven,&rdquo; he added. Punjab chief minister captain Amarinder Singh too said he did not approve of Pitroda&rsquo;s statement. &ldquo;I have said it already, I don&rsquo;t accept that statement. It&rsquo;s the duty of the successive governments to find out how it happened, who all were responsible, it must be found, doesn&rsquo;t matter how many years have passed,&rdquo; he said. The 1984 riots took place at the end of October-early November 1984 year when mobs, some allegedly including members of the Congress party, killed members of the Sikh community in retaliation for Indira Gandhi&rsquo;s assassination. &ldquo;We continue to support the quest for justice and stern punishment for those found guilty in 1984 riots as also the subsequent acts of violence including the 2002 Gujarat riots. Any opinion remark made by any individual to the contrary including Shri Sam Pitroda is not the opinion of the Congress party. We advise all leaders to be careful and sensitive,&rdquo; the Congress said in another statement that was released by chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala.While apologising, Pitroda also said his comment had been blown out of proportion. &ldquo;My Hindi is not that good, I think in English and translate in Hindi... I could not translate bura in my mind... what I really meant to say is jo hua bura hua tha (what happened was bad),&rdquo; he said.", "author": {"@type": "Person", "name": "HT Correspondent and Agencies"}, "publisher": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "Hindustan Times", "url": "https://www.hindustantimes.com", "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/images/app-images/2019/4/ht_logo.jpg", "width": 600, "height": 60}}, "image": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_1200x900/HT/p2/2019/05/10/Pictures/lok-sabha-polls-rahul-gandhi-in-chandigarh_961d52e0-7347-11e9-a742-11580f91addb.jpg", "height": 900, "width": 1200}}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "BreadcrumbList", "itemListElement": [{"@type": "ListItem", "position": 1, "item": {"@id": "https://www.smh.com.au/politics", "name": "Politics"}}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 2, "item": {"@id": "https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal", "name": "Federal"}}, {"@type": "ListItem", "position": 3, "item": {"@id": "https://www.smh.com.au/federal-election-2019", "name": "Australia votes"}}]}, {"@context": "http://schema.org", "@type": "NewsArticle", "mainEntityOfPage": {"@type": "WebPage", "@id": "https://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/2019/05/citing-moral-emergency-attorneys-seek-contempt-as-oregon-defies-mentally-ill-defendants-rights.html"}, "headline": "Citing 'moral emergency,' attorneys seek contempt as Oregon defies mentally ill defendants' rights", "url": "https://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/2019/05/citing-moral-emergency-attorneys-seek-contempt-as-oregon-defies-mentally-ill-defendants-rights.html", "thumbnailUrl": "https://www.oregonlive.com/resizer/QV0_QEZy6fe0r4un7DuAhKbKlAI=/1200x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-advancelocal.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4Y2TOEQDBNEDDKD2RT26PWBRF4.jpg", "image": "https://www.oregonlive.com/resizer/QV0_QEZy6fe0r4un7DuAhKbKlAI=/1200x0/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-advancelocal.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4Y2TOEQDBNEDDKD2RT26PWBRF4.jpg", "dateCreated": "2019-05-10T21:14:14.000Z", "datePublished": "2019-05-10T21:14:14.000Z", "dateModified": "2019-05-10T22:27:41.000Z", "publisher": {"@type": "Organization", "name": "oregonlive.com", "logo": {"@type": "ImageObject", "url": "https://static.advance.net/static/olive/static/img/logos/logo_main.png"}}, "creator": [{"@type": "Person", "name": "Gordon R.
